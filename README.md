## About

This website was created to encourage people to explore Wexford. It hopes to show people that history can be fun and accepted of all people. History can be an imtimidating subject and people can become relucant to learn much about it because it can appear dated and guarded. Wexford's history is for everyone and can combine with many other fun activities such as a pub crawl or a crazy trad music night!

### Design

* Colour Scheme
    - For this website, I took inspiration from a famous Wexford tapestry. You can read more about it [here](https://www.discoverireland.ie/wexford/the-ros-tapestry-exhibition-centre). I wanted the style of the page to not take away from the content so choose three of the colours rather than all five. The three I picked were: #35344A, #D3C7B8 and #786445.

* Typography
    - I used Google fonts for the copy
    - I used Lato for the headings. It is a fun font but also has a feeling of historical heritage
    - Oswald was used for the paragraph writings and links on the page. It is a fun, modern and stylist font which goes with the purpose of the page

* Imagery
    - Images on the page serve to show some of the highlights of Wexford. They aim to show the variety of things to see. I used royalty free images found from a search on [Unsplash.](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/wexford) The pictures are all so beautiful and really add some charm to the site. They are the spice to the site as the colour scheme is muted.
